# learning-kotlin-by-testing-it

This is about learning kotlin by treating 
this task as a TDD/BDD project (using Spek 
testing framework) in the following way:
1. Read about a language feature
2. Describe this feature in a concrete example
using Spek's given, on and it descriptions
3. Write a failing unit test for it
4. Implement an example of the feature making
 the test pass
5. Repeat these steps for all features to learn

Have fun! :)
